# Overview

After an inital discovery phase there were a few key areas identified on how to move the Shelter digital stack forward and allow for flexibility in the future.

- Allow for the devolution of digital publishing responsibilities across the business
- Allow for flexible content modelling
- Integrate with a variety of tools and services
- Futureproof Shelter's Digital publishing capabilities

Based on this the [stack](02-technical-overview.md) was described to be as decoupled as possible and to devolve responsibility to services that specialise delivering content, building static sites and modern hosting.
